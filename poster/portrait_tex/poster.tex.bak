\headerbox{Signal model}{name=signal,column=0, span=1, below=background}{
\begin{minipage}[c]{\textwidth}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4 em]
 \vspace{-2pt}
\item The downlink transmit signal vector is given by
 \vspace{-2pt}
\begin{equation}\notag
\mathbf{x} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{S}} \sqrt{P(k)}\mathbf{w}(k)s(k).
\end{equation}
${\blacktriangleright}$ $s(k),\mathbf{w}(k),P(k)$: data symbol, beamforming weight vector, and transmit power scaling factor for user $k$.

\vspace{-2pt}
\item The signal received by a user $k$ is given by:
\begin{multline}\notag
y(k) = \mathbf{h}(k)\mathbf{x}+z(k)
    = \sqrt{P(k)}\mathbf{h}(k)\mathbf{w}(k)s(k) + \\
    \sum_{j \in \mathcal{S},j \ne k}  \sqrt{P(j)}\mathbf{h}(j)\mathbf{w}(j)s(j)

${\blacktriangleright}$ $\mathbf{h}(k)= [h(k,1),...,h(k,I)]\in \mathbb{C}^{1\times I}$ : channel vector for user $k$. \\
${\blacktriangleright}$ $z(k)$: white Gaussian channel noise for user $k$.

\item  To cancel mutual interference, adopt the ZFBF based downlink precoder $ \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{H}^{\dagger} = \mathbf{H}^{*}(\mathbf{HH}^{*})^{-1}$.

%%% Results %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Associated user group construction}{name=group,column=1,span=2, below=background, bottomaligned = signal}{
\small
\emph{1)} \textbf{Initialization}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Initialize the unselected user set as the sum aggregation of the cellular user set $\mathcal{U}$ and the WiFi user set $\mathcal{V}$, i.e., $\mathcal{T}_i = \mathcal{U} +\mathcal{V}.$
            The number of initial unselected users is denoted by $K$.
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Set the iteration number $i = 1$, and the initial associated user set $\mathcal{S} = \emptyset$.
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{-2pt}
\emph{2)} \textbf{Calculation of channel orthogonal components}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Define the orthogonal components of channel vectors of the unselected users in $\mathcal{T}_{i}$ as $\mathbf{g}_{(i)}$, which are orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the selected users  $\{\mathbf{g}_{(1)},\mathbf{g}_{(2)},...,\mathbf{g}_{(i-1)}\}$.
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Calculate $\mathbf{g}(k)$ for each user $k \in \mathcal{T}_i$ as
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbf{g}(k) =
            \mathbf{h} (k) - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac {\mathbf{h}_k\mathbf{g}_j^*}{\|\mathbf{g}_{(j)}\|^2} \mathbf{g}_{(j)}
            =  \mathbf{h}(k) \mathbf{I}-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}
            \frac{\mathbf{g}_{(j)}^{*}\mathbf{g}_{(j)}}{\|\mathbf{g}_{(j)}\|^2},
            \forall k > 1,
        \end{equation}
        where  $g(k) = h(k)$ when $k = 1$.
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{-2pt}
\emph{3)} \textbf{User selection based on semiorthogonality}:
    \small
    \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The data rate of user $k$ can be approximated as $\tilde{R}_k(\mathcal{S}) = \log(1+P(k)\|\mathbf{g}(k)\|^2)$, since the selected users are semiorthogonal. When the selected users are strictly orthogonal and $P(k) = P/|\mathcal{S}|$, the original data rate of user $k$, $R_k(\mathcal{S}) = \log (1 + P(k)\|\mathbf{h}(k)\|^2)$, equals to $\tilde{R}_k(\mathcal{S})$.

        \vspace{-2pt}\item[$\blacktriangleright$] Select the optimal user $\pi(i)$ from $\mathcal{T}_i$ as
            $\pi(i) = \arg\max_{k\in{\mathcal{T}_i}} \lambda(k) \|\mathbf{g}(k)\|^2$.
        \vspace{-2pt}\item[] $\lambda(k)$ is the weight factor for user k, which provides flexibility to control the access probability of different user types.

    \textbf{Performance analysis:}
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.4 em]
    \normalsize{
             \item In Fig. 1, the selected number of WiFi and cellular users $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ with $\lambda_\mathrm{W}$, respectively.
              \item In Fig. 2, per-user WiFi data rate $\downarrow$ with $\lambda_\mathrm{W}$, while the per-user cellular data rate $\uparrow$ with $\lambda_\mathrm{W}$.
             \item From Fig. 3, the number of selected L-QoS and H-QoS cellular users both $\uparrow$ with $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$.
             Additionally, the gap between L-QoS users and H-QoS users $\uparrow$ with the cellular weight factors and $\downarrow$ with the ratio of $\lambda_\mathrm{L}/\lambda_\mathrm{H}$.
             \item From Fig. 4, the proposed scheme is better than the fully antenna association scheme in terms of the data rate.
             \item Although DPC scheme has the highest performance, the proposed scheme has a much lower computational complexity at the cost of less than $15\%$ performance loss.
             \item A higher $\lambda_\mathrm{W}$ can ensure WiFi performance, while a lower one can improve cellular users' performance.
