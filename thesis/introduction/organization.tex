The rest of this report is organized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chapter \ref{cha:theoretical-background} introduces the theoretical background of this project, including wireless communication system, MIMO radar, and reconfigurable intelligent surface.
    \item In Chapter \ref{cha:joint-design}, the system model and formulated problems are given. The detailed optimization methods for joint active and passive beamforming are presented. Both separated and shared deployments are considered.
    \item In Chapter \ref{cha:performance-evaluation}, we discuss the simulation results, including the convergence of proposed algorithms, beampattern comparison, and tradeoff comparison.
    \item In Chapter \ref{cha:conclusion}, the conclusions and potential future works are discussed.
\end{itemize}
