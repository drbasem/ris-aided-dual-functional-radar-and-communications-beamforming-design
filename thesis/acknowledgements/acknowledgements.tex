    First and foremost, I would want to convey my gratitude to Prof. Bruno Clerckx, my supervisor. His continuous help and valuable suggestions
    have been crucial for this research project. I also want to thank Mr. Rafael Cerna Loli, who was always open to answer my questions.

    In this difficult time of COVID-19, I would like to thank my friends from Imperial College London and other universities for their support.
    Their company in the most difficult moments makes my life not lonely. 

    Finally, I want to express my love to my parents. Their selfless support and encouragement have been my biggest motivation in the past year.
